Contra dancing uses many of the same traditional moves found in square dancing. With only a dozen basic moves, learning contra dance is as simple as walking and smiling. The caller walks through each dance prior to starting up the music, and then provides helpful prompts while the band is playing. \n\nThe live music is primarily Irish or Scottish in origin, with a smattering of southern or bluegrass styles. \n\nYou, the other dancers, the musicians, and the caller aim for an evening of low-pressure, yet energetic, camaraderie. Come alone or with others; we get new partners for each of the dozen or so dances that we do during the evening.','0','$8 general admission\n$6 for members\nKids under 18 half price\n\nWant to help Contra Dancing stay in the Treasure Valley?  Consider buying a membership for $15.00 and attend the dances at the membership price of $6.00 for the 2012-2013 season (September 2012 through May 2013).

That&#39;s why we&#39;ve created the Idaho Sampler Expo, to introduce new residents and all Idahoans to some of the very best companies in this great state. Businesses who stand heads above the competition. Businesses that place pride in the quality of their products or service and businesses that know the value of customer service. If you feel your company belongs to this elite few, then you will want to join with us in this Idaho Sampler Exposition. The thousands of Idaho Sampler guests will be pre-qualified. They will represent heads of households who make the buying decision for everything from groceries to clothing, insurance to remodeling, investments to healthcare, recreation to daycare, and more. When guests attend the Idaho Sampler, we know they are looking for dependable local resources. These sampler guests are the decision-makers you want your business to reach!</p>','','','2013-04-27 00:00:00',NULL,'2012-09-29 04:55:33','2012-09-29 04:55:33','evdb','http://eventful.com/gardencity_id/events/experience-idaho-2013-/E0-001-051532059-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:06',3,0),('E0-001-051532062-9',1,'V0-001-000318653-1','Idaho Family Fun Pet Expo 2013','<p>The Idaho Family Pet Expo features pet products, pet services, traditional family pets as well as the exotic, rare and beautiful animals.

ASCAP’s 2007 Songwriter of the Year, Tomlin’s “How Great Is Our God” was his first No. 1 on the CCLI Top 25, moving to No. 1 after becoming one of the fasting rising modern day hymns in CCLI chart history. In addition to having sold more than 4.2 million albums and over 6 million digital tracks, Tomlin made history as his single “Jesus Messiah” (Hello Love) garnered 97 adds at radio its first week and skyrocketed to No. 1, making it the biggest ever add date in Christian Radio history. In the midst of his record breaking success, and continuing his role as worship leader at Passion City Church in Atlanta, GA, Tomlin continues touring and leading at Passion Conference gatherings across the US and worldwide. His ninth studio album, Burning Lights, will be released on Jan. 8, 2013.\n\nAbout Kari Jobe\n\nAfter being established as one of the premier worship leaders with her Dove Award-winning, self-titled debut, Kari Jobe continues to serve as a worship pastor at Gateway Church in Southlake, Texas.

Not far from Columbia City&#39;s main drag, amidst a swirl of languages and colors and food and accents, sits a 100-year-old, two-story house that&#39;s home to the world-weary, six-piece orchestral-pop ensemble known as Hey Marseilles. World-weary in spirit if not in practice: Hey Marseilles first won hearts across the US with its 2010 debut, To Travels and Trunks, an album that reveled in the education and inspiration only globe-trotting exploration can provide. With Matt Bishop&#39;s lyrical wayfaring abutting an instrumental palette that embraced folk traditionaccordion, strings, and horns; gypsy, Gallic, and classicalTo Travels and Trunks gave musical voice to the universal longing for unfettered freedom. NPR called the record &quot;sublime and heartfelt.&quot; A lot has changed in the world since 2010that house in Columbia City, for instance. The vacillations of the economy allowed Hey Marseilles violist Jacob Anderson to acquire it in 2011; he and his younger brother, cellist and producer Sam Anderson, helped renovate it. Since then, most of the band has lived in it, and the entirety of their new album was written and recorded in it, or nearby. (Other recording spaces included a tunnel in Seattle&#39;s Golden Gardens Park, a mostly abandoned brick office building, and a church sanctuary, all because of their advantages for the band&#39;s acoustic instrumentation.) Not surprisingly, Lines We Trace is not about going out and searching. It&#39;s about finding you&#39;re already where you need to be. Make your way back home again, Bishop sings on the dusky ballad &quot;Café Lights.&quot; I am here still. &quot;These songs articulate a sense of longing, but it&#39;s a longing to appreciate what&#39;s in front of you as opposed to finding meaning in somewhere or someone else, &quot; says Bishop. &quot;It&#39;s about finding and creating home where you&#39;re at and as you are.&quot; The 12 songs on Lines We Trace represent a band steady enough in its soundpoignant, panoramic, unreservedly gorgeousthat it can expand beyond it. The string section that hums throughout &quot;Elegy&quot;quintessentially sweeping, Hey Marseilles styleshifts into finely composed abstraction for the song&#39;s final minute. Colin Richey&#39;s skittering rhythm on &quot;Bright Stars Burning&quot; is a gentle breakbeat, a sly nod to atmospheric drum &#39;n&#39; bass. &quot;Madrona&quot; and the album-closing &quot;Demian&quot; are Hey Marseilles&#39; first fully instrumental songs, a pair of echo-laden piano-and-cello dirges that are simultaneously solemn and sumptuous. &quot;Dead of Night&quot; trots along on an almost-funky, waltzy swing and gives the album its titular lyric, trumpet triumphant as Bishop sings, The lines we trace have a thousand ends/We&#39;ll count the ways we can&#39;t begin/And stay in our homes, remain on our own Throughout, Philip Kobernik&#39;s accordion is less pronounced than previously, Nick Ward&#39;s guitar more so. The result is less old-world, more new school. &quot;With our first record, we were inspired by traditional folk instrumentation and arrangements, but at our core we were trying to make solid pop songs,&quot; Bishop explains. &quot;We see this album as a continuation of that goal, but we hope the arrangements reflect our maturation as musicians and songwriters.&quot; An update. A progression. A musical analog to a line in &quot;Looking Back&quot;: If you&#39;re looking back that&#39;s all you&#39;ll ever see. Six years after Bishop first got together with Kobernik and Ward to jam at Seattle&#39;s Gasworks Park, Hey Marseilles is an experienced band with a slew of major festivals (Bumbershoot, Sasquatch!) and a national tour under its belt. They&#39;ve come a long wayonly to find themselves back home. Put another way, as Lines We Trace suggests, sometimes you don&#39;t have to go far to find a meaningful experience. Sometimes the comfort of the familiar is all you need to grow. ------------------------------------------ YOUNG BUFFALO http://www.youngbuffaloband.com/ http://www.facebook.com/youngbuffalo ------------------------------------------ HOLLOW-WOOD http://www.facebook.com/hollowwood<br> <br>','','10 - 10 USD','2013-04-13 20:00:00','2013-04-13 23:59:00','2012-12-16 21:19:54','2013-02-04 07:22:01','evdb','http://eventful.com/gardencity_id/events/hey-marseilles-also-guest-young-buffalo-and-l-/E0-001-053221704-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:22',3,0),('E0-001-053242345-5',1,'V0-001-006239597-8','Quilting-Log Cabin Sampler','<p>Participants in this class will make a lap quilt with six variations of the log cabin block.

Energy gets released; it&#39;s irresistible and infectious. That&#39;s the case on Bullet For My Valentine&#39;s fourth full-length offering, TEMPER TEMPER (RCA Records) set for release February 12, 2013. Tightening their grooves and sharpening their riffs, the Welsh quartet who has sold over 4 million albums world wide—Matt Tuck [vocals, guitar], Michael &quot;Padge&quot; Paget [guitar], Michael &quot;Moose&quot; Thomas [drums], and Jason James [bass]—fire off an incendiary collection of hard rock anthems with arena-ready bombast and metallic intensity. After a whirlwind cycle in support of 2010&#39;s Fever, the band decided to do something a little different when the time came to record album number four. Quite appropriately on Valentine&#39;s Day 2012, Tuck and &quot;Moose&quot; boarded a plane for Thailand. Instead of recording in the U.S. or UK, they collectively hunkered down at Karma Sound Studios in Bang Saray with producer Don Gilmore (Linkin Park, Rob Zombie, Hollywood Undead). The experience proved inspiring and invigorating on numerous levels. &quot;I had a bit of an idea going into this,&quot; smiles Tuck. &quot;It was basically &#39;record-as-we-go&#39;. There were no writing or demo sessions this time around. I&#39;d just done the same thing with my other band AxeWound, and it was so exciting and productive. So I asked the Bullet boys, &#39;Can we go somewhere and write and record the album?&#39; We decided on Thailand, and it was the best decision we could&#39;ve made.&quot; For almost a month, the musicians focused on amping up every element of their patented sound. They didn&#39;t want to deviate from the foundation, but rather expand upon it. Despite taking a mere two days off to ride elephants and see tigers in their natural habitat, the setting also allowed for complete immersion in the process. &quot;It&#39;s always wise to step outside of your comfort zone,&quot; the frontman continues. &quot;We didn&#39;t have to worry about anything. The studio was completely state-of-the-art, and the living quarters were fantastic. We didn&#39;t have to deal with any of the pressures or obligations that we do at home. You could wake up in the morning and go for a swim or take a jog down the beach. It was an amazing way to start every day. Everybody was in a great mood. When you&#39;re in a great mood, it encourages creativity.&quot; At the same time, they strengthened their bond with Gilmore. After working together on the Fever, the band and producer forged a singular trust that served as an integral part of the actual sessions. &quot;We&#39;ve got history,&quot; affirms Tuck. &quot;We were more willing to collaborate, and we know how each other work and tick. There&#39;s an understanding between us, and that brought confidence out of me. We slowed everything down on this record. We wanted to sound fresher and bigger without playing harder and faster.&quot; &quot;They accomplished that mission on both the album&#39;s title track and the first single, &quot;Riot.&quot; Beginning with a staggering beat, “Temper Temper” builds into a precise guitar attack coupled with one of the biggest hooks of their career to date. About the song, Tuck reveals, &quot;I wanted to say something about anger management and temper, but I didn&#39;t want to come off negatively. That&#39;s the twist. The release of negative energy is great. It feels good when you lose control. It doesn&#39;t mean you have to go smash someone&#39;s face in. You can kick a soccer ball around a field. You can pick up a guitar and rock out. As long as it&#39;s positive, let it come out.&quot; Then, there&#39;s &quot;Riot.&quot; Slipping from heavy to hypnotic, Tuck reflected upon the 2011 rioting and looting in the United Kingdom within the lyrics. &quot;The riots were on primetime news constantly,&quot; he remembers. &quot;It was crazy how much it impacted the media. I indulged in a bit of a punk rock theme, spicing up the record with the lyrics. There are two things going on in there. The song itself is about those riots, but there&#39;s also that hard rock vibe that we&#39;ll stick together and rise up.&quot; Everything kicks off with &quot;Breaking Point.&quot; Forging a fast and fiery assault, the band bursts right out of the gate with intense, incisive thrashing. The singer goes on, &quot;The song sums up the feeling of the album. Everybody has their breaking point. It&#39;s something we all share in common, and I wanted to convey that point.&quot; They&#39;ve excelled at getting their point across with a bang since forming back in Wales at the turn of the century. In 2006, they became an international phenomenon with the release of their debut album, The Poison, which became certified Gold for sales in excess of 500,000. Their second full-length, Scream Aim Fire, debuted at #4 on the Billboard Top 200. However, the band would enjoy their highest chart debut with 2010&#39;s Fever debuting at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and #1 on the Rock and Alternative charts. Cumulatively, sales for the group exceed four million worldwide. They&#39;ve given explosive performances at both Download Festival and The Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival. In addition, the group has been the recipient of the Metal Hammer &quot;Golden God&quot; Award for &quot;Best British&quot; band in 2006 and 2010 and scored an impressive seven Kerrang! Awards. However, TEMPER TEMPER signals the start of Bullet For My Valentine&#39;s biggest and best chapter yet. &quot;We wanted to make songs that would stand the test of time,&quot; concludes Tuck. &quot;Every track takes you on a little journey, and that&#39;s what music should do for people. We&#39;ve gone through the stage of having to prove ourselves. We&#39;re men now. We want to please ourselves first and hopefully our fan base with what we do. We&#39;re not worrying about what critics think or say. We&#39;re not interested in genres or labels either. It&#39;s about doing what comes naturally. I can sleep at night knowing the boys and I have made the fucking best record we could&#39;ve.&quot; </p></p>','','$29.50 - $59.50','2013-04-14 18:30:00',NULL,'2013-01-23 06:09:57','2013-01-29 08:29:03','evdb','http://eventful.com/gardencity_id/events/bullet-my-valentine-/E0-001-053994822-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:24',3,0),('E0-001-054007616-4',1,'V0-001-000307781-7','RACHMANINOV - Boise Philharmonic Association','<br>RACHMANINOV - Boise Philharmonic Association<br> Direct ticket sales<br>Music Concert<br>8:00 PM<br><a href=\"http://www.boisephilharmonic.org/buy-tickets/tabid/5696/ProdID/213/RtnTab/5696/PageIndex/4/CatID/-1/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>','','','2013-05-04 20:00:00',NULL,'2013-01-23 14:38:51','2013-01-23 14:38:51','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/rachmaninov-boise-philharmonic-association-/E0-001-054007616-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:26',3,1),('E0-001-054018666-5',1,'V0-001-000139485-3','Watsky featuring Dumbfoundead','','','$11.00 - $20.00','2013-04-20 20:30:00',NULL,'2013-01-24 02:00:58','2013-01-24 02:00:58','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/watsky-featuring-dumbfoundead-/E0-001-054018666-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:50',3,0),('E0-001-054020490-7',1,'V0-001-006678868-0','Diego\'s Umbrella','<b>Age Limit: </b> All Ages<br> <br> Diego&#39;s Umbrella<br> <br> <br> <br>','','FREE','2013-04-13 16:30:00',NULL,'2013-01-24 03:56:59','2013-04-05 05:11:18','evdb','http://eventful.com/sunvalley_id/events/diegos-umbrella-/E0-001-054020490-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:21',3,0),('E0-001-054037998-2@2013060720',1,'V0-001-000307781-7','The Buddy Holly Story','<b>Location:</b> <br> Morrison Center <br><br> <b>Calendar:</b> <br>Entertainment<br><br> <b>Contact:</b> <br>virginiatreat@boisestate.edu - Virginia Treat<br><br> <b>Description:</b> <br>June 7, 2013 • 8:00 PM June 8, 2013 • 2:00 PM & 8:00 PM Ticket Prices (Service fees not included) P1 $52.50 - Floor Rows AA - Z P2 $52.50 - Mezzanine Rows A - D P3 $42.50 - Mezzanine Rows E - I P4 $32.50 - Mezzanine Rows J - N *Demand pricing may be implemented if/when ticket inventory becomes limited and all discount offers will be discontinued at that time.

The songs made by the Huntington Beach duo—Melissa Marie Green and Allison Green —will make you want to gouge out your ears. They are the downfall of society. 2010, the year their debut full-length is scheduled to come out, will probably bring the Apocalypse. Wait a second. That can&#39;t be true. Catchy, fun electro-pop songs made by cute, foul-mouthed girls who are both 21 and under can&#39;t possibly be the thing that ends the world, can it? Truth is, their songs aren&#39;t gonna ruin anything… except maybe the credibility of some Internet haters when it turns out they like Millionaires. The girls get it. They know their band started as an accident, when Melissa Marie and Allison started fucking around on GarageBand one day in the summer of 2007 and made their first song &quot;I Like Money.&quot; They know it&#39;s been a combination of a strong DIY work ethic, a unique sense of style and a willingness to put their fast-talking, in-your-face songs into the scrutiny of the public that&#39;s transformed them from a one-time joke to a serious band. They know it takes guts to write bouncy, hooky, indefinable songs about alcohol and sex and boys—and to perform those songs on stage during their unstoppable live shows. They know it takes determination and steadfast self-promotion to sell out two headlining tours before ever releasing an album. They know that MTV doesn&#39;t ask just any band to perform live on one of the final episodes of TRL and pen the theme songs for Teen Cribs and A Double Shot at Love. They know the album they&#39;ve been working on is going to be gobbled up by haters and fans alike. Because that&#39;s another thing: Millionaires are aware that a lot people have a lot of nasty things to say about them and their music. And you know what? They don&#39;t give a shit. </p></p>','','$14.00 - $16.00','2013-04-18 18:30:00',NULL,'2013-01-29 09:03:54','2013-02-08 02:46:55','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/millionaires-/E0-001-054172411-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:36',3,0),('E0-001-054172472-7',1,'V0-001-000257374-9','Barb Wire Dolls','<p> Supporting Acts: Demoni, ART FAD, Mind Drips <p> Barb Wire Dolls <br><br> &quot;Barb Wire Dolls are the most explosive and exciting new punk band I&#39;ve seen in decades!&quot; - Mickey Leigh/brother of the late Joey Ramone and ex-tour manager for the Ramones. Being heralded as &quot;the most important punk invasion to the U.S. since the Sex Pistols&quot; (PMP) and receiving the &quot;Best Live Punk Act&quot; award in 2012 (Indy PRN), Barb Wire Dolls have become the critics and fans new choice as leaders of today&#39;s new generation of punk bands. &quot;Like a shot heard around the world, Barb Wire Dolls are a true-to-the-genre punk band&quot; - Guitar World. After getting non stop airplay on Los Angeles&#39; KROQ, Barb Wire Dolls were invited by the radio station to the U.S. for a series of concerts where they stormed L.A.&#39;s music scene by selling out the Roxy Theatre, packing monthly residencies at the Viper Room, and attracting to their shows members of the Sex Pistols, Black Flag, L7, Flogging Molly, D Generation, and Frances Bean Cobain. Hailing from Europe, and specifically the crisis-ridden Greece, Barb Wire Dolls is a politically charged blast of high energy rock and roll that combines first wave punk, grunge, and metal riffs. With comparisons ranging from &quot;a more punk rock Hole&quot; to &quot;Blondie meets the Plasmatics&quot;, the band is fronted by the wild and out spoken blond bombshell Isis Queen along with guitarist Pyn and drummer Krash. In November of 2012 Barb Wire Dolls released their much anticipated label debut Slit (Darla Records) recorded by Steve Albini (Nirvana, Stooges, Pixies) with three record release shows in New York City. Barb Wire Dolls since forming in 2010 have completed two coast to coast tours of America sharing the bill with TSOL, Cro Mags, Sublime lbc, Angry Samoans, Mushroomhead, Static X, and Status Quo, headlined major festivals on both sides of the Atlantic, played direct support to Jello Biafra (Dead Kennedy&#39;s) and Bouncing Souls, worked with A&R mogul Tom Zutaut (Guns N&#39; Roses, Metallica, Motley Crue), headlined two SXSW showcases, garnered a Top Ten radio hit in South America, &quot;Punk Rock Revolution&quot; a photo book on the band was published by Spin magazine photographer Stets, and Barb Wire Dolls graced the cover of three magazines (Punk Globe, Hollywood Weekly, and BPS). 2013 is starting off with a bang with the world-wide release of a split vinyl single with OFF! (featuring Keith Morris/ex-frontman of Black Flag and Circle Jerks), another U.S. coast to coast headlining and supporting tour (tba), a co-headlining U.K. tour with punk legends GBH, 999, & The Lurkers, and more European summer festival appearances. </p></p>','','$10.00','2013-04-28 18:30:00',NULL,'2013-01-29 09:06:21','2013-03-26 03:24:11','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/barb-wire-dolls-/E0-001-054172472-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:09',3,0),('E0-001-054190633-0',1,'V0-001-001140831-3','Lord Huron with Papa','','','$5.00','2013-03-30 20:00:00',NULL,'2013-01-30 02:22:04','2013-03-23 01:59:24','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/lord-huron-papa-/E0-001-054190633-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-03-29 15:00:23',3,1),('E0-001-054193126-6',1,'V0-001-000935697-4','Jaime Thietten','<b>Age Limit: </b> All Ages<br> <br> Jaime Thietten<br> <br> <br> <br>','','','2013-05-19 14:00:00',NULL,'2013-01-30 04:27:35','2013-01-30 08:13:39','evdb','http://eventful.com/nampa/events/jaime-thietten-/E0-001-054193126-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:54',3,0),('E0-001-054214706-8',1,'V0-001-000257374-9','Pentatonix','','','','2013-04-30 19:30:00',NULL,'2013-01-31 05:40:53','2013-01-31 05:40:53','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/pentatonix-/E0-001-054214706-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:20',3,0),('E0-001-054223828-1',1,'V0-001-005938048-0','Experience Idaho Expo','The 7th Annual Experience Idaho Expo at Expo Idaho, highlights businesses right here in our great state.

But now, Even Aranbul has replaced Forsgren, Mindy White with Dais De Sicilia, and Craig Taylor with Brinton and added second guitarist, Ethan Koozer. Debut album, &quot;This December; It&#39;s One More and I&#39;m Free&quot; was recorded by the former members of the band and was released on September 27th, 2005 with the HourZero Records. The band (then Leighton, Steve, Ethan, Evan and Mindy White) released their sophomore album &quot;Illuminate&quot; to extremely positive reviews and gained a great following. The band released their (at the time) final album, Assailants on July 20, 2010. They followed it up with the Goodbye & Farewell Tour in both the United States and Australia. After a year long hiatus, Leighton and Craig decided to write, record, and release a brand new album under the Lydia name in the summer of 2011, called Paint It Golden. Lydia will release their long-anticipated &quot;Devil&quot; on March 19th, 2013! </p></p>','','$12.00 - $15.00','2013-04-20 18:30:00',NULL,'2013-02-03 08:34:19','2013-03-29 03:54:06','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/lydia-/E0-001-054280317-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:48',3,0),('E0-001-054294099-7@2013040220',1,'V0-001-006386339-7','Open Mic with Zack Quintana!','Zack Quintana will be hosting an acoustic open mic every Tuesday starting at 8:00 PM.

Opio and Pep Love of the famed Hieroglyphics hip hop collective have joined forces to illuminate the day and expound upon the Hiero theme of random acts of musical collaboration. First Light gets its cue from the braggadocio and conceptual characteristics that were commonly expressed in the early nineties &quot;Golden Era&quot; of hip hop. But, at the same time, their way of displaying an affinity for and a loathing of the apathy and debauchery that permeates today&#39;s pop culture is poetically contradictory. Hence, the title of their debut album Fallacy Fantasy in stores March 12th 2013. First Light group members Opio and Pep Love will be lighting up live shows on metropolitan spot dates, college promo dates and chittlin circuit jook joints in the middle of nowhere in the lead up to the release of their debut project Fallacy Fantasy. In the interim they&#39;ll still be giving their fans samples of their latest work while performing with the Hieroglyphics collective in a whirlwind of upcoming activity starting in mid January that will include leaks, documentary behind the scenes footage and music videos. . With Unjust from Chosen Few picking up most of the production work Fallacy Fantasy has a varying musical style throughout and begins with a bang on the song Greetings with Pep starting &quot;Gentlemen start your engines spittin this art is vintage, I&#39;m emptying cartridges of bars at audiences&#39;&quot;. As the record continues into songs like Los Lobos Opio&#39;s acumen for weaving together phrases and fragments over this somber psychedelic melody are immediately apparent. First Light&#39;s debut album Fallacy Fantasy will stimulate the hypothalamus and keep you warm in the winter, dry in the rain and cool in tropical heat.

These bands frequently played together and established the Austin hardcore scene. They released one single as the Stains in 1981, featuring a slower version of the future MDC song &quot;John Wayne Was a Nazi&quot; backed with &quot;Born to Die&quot;. Both songs were later released on the debut MDC album. [edit] 1980s By 1982 the band had relocated to San Francisco, California, and renamed themselves MDC. By this point the band were active participants in the growing hardcore scene and released their debut LP Millions of Dead Cops on their own label, R Radical; Jello Biafra&#39;s Alternative Tentacles helped with distribution. The album is now widely considered a punk classic, and features songs such as &quot;John Wayne Was a Nazi&quot;, &quot;Dick for Brains&quot;, and the harsh criticism of the police, &quot;I Remember&quot;. Other targets of criticism devoid of irony included capitalism (&quot;Corporate Death Burger&quot;), homophobia (&quot;America&#39;s So Straight&quot;),[1] and American culture (&quot;Violent Rednecks&quot;). During the summer of 1982 they became involved in the Rock Against Reagan Tour, during which time they fell out with the band Bad Brains when Rastafarian singer H.R. learned that Big Boys&#39; singer , Randy Turner, was homosexual. H.R. and MDC&#39;s Dave Dictor had an intense confrontation. Upon Bad Brains&#39; departure from the bill, they refused to return a loan owed to Big Boys and instead left a note that reportedly read, &quot;burn in hell bloodclot faggot.&quot;[2] The indcident resulted in the MDC song Pay to Come Along.[3] For MDC, 1982 ended with a tour of Europe with the Dead Kennedys which brought the band greater exposure in the punk scene outside of the U.S., especially in the UK. Their involvement in the Rock Against Reagan activities continued through 1983 and they returned to recording with the EP &quot;Multi-Death Corporations&quot; which was distributed in the UK by British anarcho-punk label Crass Records and R Radical in the U.S. The EP broke new ground by addressing, in the lengthy liner notes and artwork, the growth of corporations and the violent suppression of Communism in Central America. In 1984 they released another EP, Millions of Dead Children (also known as Chicken Squawk), this time dealing with Vegetarian and Vegan issues via a cowpunk tune. Smoke Signals was released in 1986, their second album featuring a more diverse style than previously, with a foray into &#39;70s rock with the song &quot;South Africa Is Free&quot;. This album also saw Gordon Fraser&#39;s first appearance as main guitarist. Their third album, This Blood&#39;s for You, followed in 1987 and saw them returning to a more orthodox hardcore punk style with themes again including intervention in Central America and criticism of the Reagan Administration. MDC toured Europe in 1988, where the live album Elvis - In the Rhineland was recorded. The band released the album Metal Devil Cokes in 1989. [edit] 1990s The 1990s opened with a number of lineup changes, swiftly followed by the 1991 album Hey Cop! If I Had a Face Like Yours..., featuring Bill Collins on guitar and Matt Freeman (of Operation Ivy) on bass. The acclaimed Shades of Brown album appeared in 1993, released by New Red Archives in the U.S. and We Bite in Europe. The album featured the Hip-Hop vegetarian song &quot;Real Food, Real People, Real Bullets&quot;. The band, now with guitarist Chris Wilder and bassist Erica Liss, marked the album with a tour of the former Soviet Union, making MDC the first American punk band to tour Russia. This was followed by two more European tours and several U.S. tours until 1995, where began a lull in the band&#39;s activity. The lack of new recorded material (other than a 7-inch release on Slap-a-Ham Records) and live performances after 1994, plus personal problems of band members, pointed to an informal break-up of the band. [edit] 2000s MDC&#39;s singer, Dave Dictor, returned with an entirely new backing line-up in 2000, and MDC released a new album, Magnus Dominus Corpus, in 2004. They took part in a 25th anniversary world tour in 2005, with an all-original lineup. Following the death of Mikey Donaldson in September 2007, MDC has been touring the U.S. and Europe extensively with the Dictor/Posner/Smith/Schvitz lineup. Recently, the band has been based in Portland, Oregon.

Skyrocketing bursts of oscillating guitar leads layer an ominous and dark undercurrent of rhythm. While hardcore punk may be the sound that rules the day in The Contortionist hometown of Indianapolis, it is the band’s signature brand of forward thinking heavy metal that has made them stick out as hometown favorites. The band worked hard to amass a following beyond Indiana though consistent regional shows, coastal touring, and two self-released EPs. They clearly began to define their sound and grow as musicians on their EP titled &quot;Apparition&quot;. The songwriting and progression on &quot;Apparition&quot; smacks of a group of musicians who are locked deeply into a remarkable place of expression and creativity that is usually reserved for bands with multiple albums under their belt. While it is not uncommon lately for bands in the world of metal to experiment with melody and progression, many times these breaks from the brutal end up sounding forced, too contrived, or way too over the top in shred. What could have been an opportunity for the listener to settle into some depth, winds up missing the mark. When The Contortionist venture into the realm of ambiance it actually raises the level of the song above the crushing breakdowns and demands the listener stay put for the ride. More impressive than their ability to write and record such material, is how big it all plays live. The room seems to expand and fill with spacious tones just in time to be leveled with ferocity. The band is razor sharp while nailing every bit of nuance their ambitious songwriting offers. It is this ability to dole out their sounds in epic proportions through a live performance that piqued the interest of record label Good Fight Music. The band had already distinguished themselves to Good Fight with a penchant for creating a distinct style of heavy music that has plenty of room for the listener to breathe and settle into.

The 3D Live company, an offshoot of George Lucas&#39; ILM, is responsible for the technology used on the trek. Claypool says, &quot;It&#39;s a pretty adventurous undertaking. Had we not done it once before, I&#39;d be a little skeptical. But the show we did at the San Francisco Opera House was pretty amazing and the notion of touring it seems to be an even more amazing concept, so we&#39;re doing it.&quot; The way it works is that fans will be issued 3-D goggles upon entry to the shows and what happens next is truly a treat. Claypool explains that he and his band &quot;actually turn around during improv sections and sort of jam along with our visualist&quot; and the images that are being created for the run. The bassist says, &quot;The past couple of years, Primus has gotten pretty psychedelic. We keep joking that we&#39;re bringing acid rock back to the masses, and I think this is another enhancing element of that.&quot; In addition to the unique quality that having a 3-D experience will add, Claypool says that each show will provide something different for the audience. The band continue to promote their 2011 release &#39;Green Naugahyde,&#39; and Claypool says that at present they haven&#39;t really begun to think about a new record yet. </p>','','$35.00 - $55.00','2013-05-12 20:00:00',NULL,'2013-02-26 03:03:04','2013-02-26 03:03:04','evdb','http://eventful.com/gardencity_id/events/primus-3d-/E0-001-054801575-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:41',3,2),('E0-001-054802093-0',1,'V0-001-000878119-1','Off Road Sprint Triathlon - Caldwell, ID','The Off-Road Sprint Triathlon will consist of a Friday pool swim, followed by a Saturday bike and run taking place at the Eagle Idaho Sports Complex and VeloPark Bike Park.

So Like always here is another one for you! HIGH ON LIFE! 4/19/13 will feature an amazing Headlining artist Support from some local favorites! <br><br>~LUCKY DATE~<br><br><a href=\"http://luckydateofficial.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://luckydateofficial.com/</a><br><br>Even with an alias like Lucky Date, Jordan Atkins-Loria had to hustle hard to carve out his own space in the electronic dance music world.<br><br>His diligent devotion to the craft has recently begun to payoff in a big way though. With an inimitable progressive house sound, he’s become a sought-after artist and remixer, drawing the attention and endorsement of everyone from David Guetta and Tommy Lee to Porter Robinson and Excision. However, it’s taken a lot more than luck for him to get here…<br><br>Since growing up in San Francisco, rhythm has fueled Jordan’s life. At five-years-old, he picked up a drum set and instantly immersed himself in music. During high school, production became his passion. While at an after school program, he learned how to make his own beats and utilize Reason, even selling tracks to local kids for a whopping twenty bucks a pop. An eye-opening experience occurred just before his relocation to Chicago for college though.<br><br>“I started going to raves in the Bay Area,” he recalls. “I was just blown away by electronic music, especially hearing some of the early Benny Benassi material. I knew the production was similar enough to what I’d done with hip hop, but I was still a little nervous to try it. Once I moved to Chicago, I set out to make straight-up electronic and house music.”<br><br>Now, he hasn’t turned back. In 2010, Spencer & Hill enlisted his talents for a remix of “Dub Disco”, and Jordan simultaneously worked as a synth engineer creating packs of preset sounds for David Guetta as well as others. Concurrently, he created a YouTube channel, featuring his music and demos on how-to produce. The page is something of a phenomenon online, generating nearly 6 million views and garnered over 15k subscribers. It also separates him from the pack. “I didn’t get fans the usual way,” smiles Jordan. “I got people’s attention from my YouTube tutorials. When I was transitioning into electronic music, I searched out a lot of tutorials so I could learn, and there wasn’t a whole lot out there. So, I began making them myself. I love teaching, and sometimes I’ll even do college seminars at local colleges the day before a show.”<br><br>Buzz began building online for his enigmatic and energetic style, and he quickly became a presence in the scene. His remix of Datsik + Bare’s “King Kong” kicked off a remixing a hot streak during 2012. Next, he dropped a sizzling hot remix of Madonna’s “Girl Gone Wild” for her official remix release also featuring Avicii and Dada Life. He followed that up with a remix of “Cudi The Kid”, the powerhouse collaboration between Steve Aoki, Travis Barker, and Kid Cudi.<br><br>Still, there’s nothing quite like Lucky Date’s original music. He penned “Fall Into the Sky” alongside Zedd and featuring Ellie Goulding, and it comes to life like a dream, merging swirling soundscapes with inescapable energy. That energy remains a hallmark of all his music, ultimately.<br><br>Jordan describes the sound best, “Although the music can be really hard and heavy, it’s still progressive house in the fact that it’s always progressing and building. There’s a lot of tension. I like messing around with that by creating big sounds that drop into the opposite feeling. The crowds tend to react to that.”<br><br>You can feel that artful manipulation of tension on his original gems “Six 16″ and “I Want You”. The latter even features a captivating and catchy vocal from Jordan himself.<br><br>Having toured with the likes of Excision, he’s also crafted a show that’s not to be missed. “It’s completely energy packed,” he hypes. “I take people on a roller coaster of huge ups and downs. I’m constantly trying to interact with the crowd as much as I can. There’s a lot of jumping up and down and bouncing.”<br><br>Ultimately, that shared experience is paramount for Lucky Date. “I want to make music that’s as accessible to as many people as possible,” he concludes. “I’m all about pulling everyone in. It’s more about fun than getting dirty or grimy. I simply hope everyone has a blast.”<br><br>LOCAL DJ SUPPORT<br><br>KOITZ (Boise, ID)<br><br>Bio to come<br><br>AARON LIVEN (Boise, ID)<br><br>Aaron Liven has been involved in electronic music since the 1990s.

Yet every year more than 80 percent of low-income children miss this crucial milestone. If left unchecked, this problem will undermine efforts to end intergenerational poverty, close the achievement gap, and reduce high school dropout rates.<p>Communities must address this problem with a collaborative approach, bringing the education system, libraries, business leaders, social service agencies, and policy-makers together cohesively to develop an action plan which addresses the unique needs within that community. These &quot;Community Campaigns&quot; are finding success in 124 communities around the country and are part of a network sponsored by the <a href=\"http://gradelevelreading.net/about-us/campaign-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Campaign for Grade Level Reading</a>.

From day one Rusko was surrounded by music whether it be his families piano&#39;s, guitars, banjo&#39;s and saxophones…or in his later years the heavy reggae and dub sound systems of Leeds, music has always been an integral part of Rusko&#39;s life. After graduating from Leeds university with a degree in musical performance, Rusko discovered the world of dubstep through SUB DUB and a debut appearance from the &quot;Digital Mystikz&quot;, having spent the past 10 years making future dub alongside Leeds very own Iration Steppas, Rusko connected with the sound and moved down to London to further advance his musical opportunities. Veering away from the dark, serious side of the sound Rusko bought a highly driven energy and fun approach to the dubstep massive, quickly coining his own take on the genre that infected . His sound appealed to many people outside of the dubstep world as his productions became more adventurous in formula, sound and energy. His huge hit &quot;Cockney Thug&quot; has been played by everyone from Pete Tong, Switch, Diplo and Santogold. And has been remixed by Buraka Som sistema, Diplo, Drop the Lime and the Scratch Perverts. Now part of the Mad Decent Camp with collaborations on the horizon with the likes of Switch, Diplo , Santigold, Trouble Andrew, Hot Chip and more…the future sure is looking bright. Currently setting the radio airwaves alight with his own productions and remixes of artists such as The Prodigy, Basement Jaxx, Little Boots and plenty more, Rusko is only going in one direction. Onwards, upwards and far beyond any other young producer could dream of. </p>','','$29.50 - $59.50','2013-05-25 20:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-12 06:47:10','2013-03-12 06:47:10','evdb','http://eventful.com/gardencity_id/events/rusko-/E0-001-055145806-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:58',3,0),('E0-001-055147014-4@2013032900',1,'V0-001-000535977-9','Schedule March 25-31','<b>Location:</b> Nampa Civic Center<br>  Monday, March 25, 2013 <br> City-Zumba Class<br> City - Dept.

Grove St. in Downtown Boise’s Linen District. $7. All ages, full bar (I.D. required), Pie Hole pizza. Plenty of free, off-street parking is available at the Linen Building. The Hokum Hoedown is a modern take on the old-time hootenanny featuring the infectious swing of the Hokum Hi-Flyers acoustic string band. At each Hoedown (first Friday of every month), the Hokum boys perform a diverse assortment of traditional folk-dance and string-band tunes while a cast of colorful callers directs the dances. In addition to square dancing, the Hokum Hoedown features some good old-fashioned, swingin’, two-steppin’ western dancing. Young and old, couples and families, tattooed hipsters and ten-gallon cowboys ... the Hokum Hoedown is a come-as-you-are, hand-clappin’ hootenanny for all.

Hugh served as a pastor among Portuguese-speaking residents of Maputo, (People&#39;s Republic of) Mozambique, for nearly four years. Four years as lead editor of Nazarene publications for Africa Region while living in Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa, during the latter apartheid years, were very formative in ministry in a complex multi-cultural context. Four more years were spent in Johannesburg teaching South African student-pastors, along with twenty-one years in the Kingdom of Swaziland at Nazarene College of Theology. Working with developing national staff and instructing fantastic pastor-students brought a great sense of ministry convergence. Several of those years in Swaziland were spent in ministry among refugees from East Africa and in an inter-denominational and international Christian fellowship in a nearby agricultural community. Now retired and living in Nampa, Idaho, the Fribergs are enjoying ministry in their home church and in Perspectives. Their greatest ministry, however, is helping guide four wonderful grandchildren to maturity! Want to see their pictures?<br><br> Autobiography : “To God be the Glory!”<br> Hughlon R. Friberg<br> Growing up in a parsonage was a joy, most of the time, for the Friberg Five. Our dad was saved out of a rather rough un-churched background in northeastern Montana, and our mother had been raised in a Pilgrim Holiness family in northern Idaho. They met when the Fribergs moved to Coeur d’Alene and Ray and Hazel attended high school together. Dad was attracted to Mother, her family and their Lord, and was saved soon thereafter. He was also called to pastoral ministry and they began their studies at Northwest Nazarene College upon graduation from high school.<br> I was born soon before they graduated and left Nampa, Idaho, for Dad’s first pastorate. A series of short pastorates in Montana and Wyoming passed and four more Fribergs were added to the family. Being older than the other four and having serious health issues as a child, I grew up nearly an only child. We moved to Washington State when I was in junior high (middle school). But along the way I had been open to God’s work in my life and had repented at five years of age, and felt a call to missions when I was eight or nine, when God spoke to me during a presentation by Louise (Robinson) Chapman, a missionary to Swaziland in Africa.<br> The Seattle area was a great area to be in high school, with involvement in district, zone and local youth events and Youth for Christ, in particular. When Dad felt called to plant a new church in a nearby community, the whole family jumped in to help. These were important formative years for me and my siblings, and three of us are involved in active ministry.<br> Going to Northwest Nazarene College for pre-medical studies came next, because I believed that would be the best way to serve God as a missionary, with my interest in mathematics, science and people. I had no inclination toward pastoral, educational, agricultural, literature or compassionate ministry during those years. College life at NNC was great, and I was very involved in student leadership and activities, including Christian Workers’ Band and the missions club. Evelyn and I met during those years.<br> When the doors to medical school did not open upon graduation from my undergraduate studies, I decided to attend Nazarene Theological Seminary for a year, and then reapply to medical school; but upon beginning my studies in Kansas City and getting married to Evelyn, my understanding of other areas of ministry began to expand. I served for a year in the mid-west in an associate pastoral position, and then we returned to the northwestern United States to pastor for two years, and I was ordained during that time.<br> The call to missions remained strong during those years and in 1971 our application for missionary service was accepted and we were appointed missionaries to Mozambique by the General Board of the Church of the Nazarene. We resigned our church, had our first child, and headed off to Portugal for language study.<br> The next thirty-nine years have gone by in a blur. During our one four-year term in Mozambique, Rev. Armand Doll and I, and a number of other Christian workers and just ordinary folks were arrested and imprisoned for months without charge by the new Communist government. Our second and third children were also born during this time. Evelyn and I were reassigned to the Republic of South Africa, where we served two four-year terms, working in literature development and then pastoral preparation. Following that we served more than twenty years in the Kingdom of Swaziland, continuing in the ministry of pastoral education there. Mobilizing and preparing workers for the harvest is my deep desire.<br> These ministries have put us in contact with many wonderful people in North America and southern Africa, and the training of pastors still beats in my heart as I attempt to fulfill the calling found in my life verse, Matthew 28:16-20, of “making disciples of all nations”, even here in North America. <br> I am enjoying being in Nampa, Idaho, again, where our two daughters and their families live. Our oldest daughter has three young sons, and I am especially enjoying being a part of their lives in these important days. Most of my activities these days have been in getting established on American soil, getting a house, buying a car, and sorting through the jetsam and flotsam of our lives. When I find the time, I want to organize all the stamps I’ve collected, and slides and photos I’ve taken down through the years in all our travels, and maybe even read some of the books I’ve collected!<br>','','$10.00','2013-05-02 07:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-16 21:40:47','2013-03-23 13:25:07','evdb','http://eventful.com/nampa/events/mayors-community-prayer-breakfast-/E0-001-055241779-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:23',3,0),('E0-001-055247693-2',1,'V0-001-000139485-3','Authmentis - Abrielway - Cure For The Fall - aaron2013','knittingfactory box office','','','2013-04-05 20:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-17 00:59:11','2013-03-17 00:59:11','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/authmentis-abrielway-cure-fall-aaron2013-/E0-001-055247693-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-05 02:58:43',3,0),('E0-001-055249026-0',1,'V0-001-005239086-8','Capital Educators Federal Credit Union Blood Drive','Donation Types: Blood','','','2013-06-18 08:30:00','2013-06-18 12:30:00','2013-03-17 01:52:30','2013-04-07 21:41:20','evdb','http://eventful.com/meridian_id/events/capital-educators-federal-credit-union-blood-dr-/E0-001-055249026-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:01:24',3,0),('E0-001-055249193-1',1,'V0-001-000652989-8','Boise Parks and Recreation Blood Drive','Donation Types: Blood','','','2013-06-20 09:00:00','2013-06-20 13:00:00','2013-03-17 02:02:33','2013-04-07 21:55:58','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/boise-parks-and-recreation-blood-drive-/E0-001-055249193-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:01:24',3,0),('E0-001-055249540-5',1,'V0-001-000541542-8','Downtown Family YMCA Blood Drive','Donation Types: Blood','','','2013-06-24 14:00:00','2013-06-24 18:00:00','2013-03-17 02:15:30','2013-04-07 22:28:31','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/downtown-family-ymca-blood-drive-/E0-001-055249540-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:01:26',3,0),('E0-001-055258589-6',1,'V0-001-005260460-0','Johnny Shoes','','','','2013-04-25 18:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-17 08:40:36','2013-03-17 08:40:36','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/johnny-shoes-/E0-001-055258589-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:54',3,0),('E0-001-055260863-8',1,'V0-001-002263074-1','Sensory Illumination','Sensory Illumination is ecstatic to present our 7th annual party at China Blue.

The rap and R{e_description}amp;B label appeared out of nowhere a little over a year ago and blew up with the release of several YouTube music videos that have gone viral and racked up millions of views along the way. The label features rappers with names like Yung Humma, Flynt Flossy, Whatchyamacallit and Slick Mahony who appear in videos that look like they were made on a Character Generator by a high school telecommunications class in 1997. A typical TJ video doesn&#39;t come close to resembling a professional music video by today&#39;s standards. Instead, they make use of cheap video effects and convenience store props like Flynt Flossy&#39;s signature fake mustache. Picture an R. Kelly video mixed with one of Andy Samberg&#39;s &#39;Saturday Night Live&#39; Digital Shorts, and you have a Turquoise Jeep music video. TJ has no Wikipedia page, and there is very little factual information available on the Internet besides the label&#39;s Facebook and Twitter accounts. When asked where TJ is based, Flossy completely dodged the question. &#39;&#39;We want EVERYONE to relate and feel a part of the Turquoise Jeep experience. So that&#39;s why we are not big on boasting about where we are from and where we are at; wherever our true fans are is where the JEEP is located which is everywhere, feel me baby?&#39;&#39; The label was started by Flossy and the label&#39;s smooth-singing R{e_description}amp;B star, Whatchyamacallit. &#39;&#39;Well basically I was sick and tired of a lot of things that come with being in this business, feel me baby? Then one day after getting into a heated argument with this record exec it really hit me, I was surrounded by so much talent that other labels overlooked. It only made sense I start up a label. So I immediately hit up the homie Whatchyamacallithe was like straight up &#39;LET&#39;S DO THIS,&#39;&#39;&#39; Flossy said. According to YouTube, TJ&#39;s biggest hit is &#39;&#39;Lemme Smang It&#39;&#39; by Yung Humma and Flynt Flossy. The video premiered in October of 2010 and it has already been viewed over 2 million times. It&#39;s known as the TJ anthem and it&#39;s often used as a starting point for new converts. The term &#39;&#39;smang&#39;&#39; was coined by Flossy as a combination of the words &#39;&#39;smash&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;bang.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Flossy hit me up one day and was telling me about this chick he was kickin it with and how she was bragging on what she was gonna do to him or whatever and he said that he told her he wasn&#39;t gonna smash or bang those panties, but he was gonna smang em,&#39;&#39; Humma said. The label now sells t-shirts that say &#39;&#39;Lemme Smang It Girl,&#39;&#39; and the word &#39;&#39;smang&#39;&#39; has become part of the online lexicon. On December 15, 2010, TJ released the mixtape &#39;Turquoise Jeep Records: Keep The Jeep Ridin.&#39; It features all the best songs like &#39;&#39;Fried or Fertilized,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Lemme Smang It&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Cavities&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Stretchy Pants.&#39;&#39; It can be downloaded from iTunes. In January of 2011, TJ played its only known concert opening for Big Boi of Outkast at a gig in Atlanta. A brief video was posted online showing hundreds of excited, college-aged fans. &#39;&#39;We drove six hours to keep the jeep riding,&#39;&#39; one said. The success of &#39;&#39;Lemme Smang It&#39;&#39; and other TJ videos has allowed the label to expand and seek bigger and better things. &#39;&#39;We&#39;re actually in the process of expanding with our newly signed artists. I only gave y&#39;all that inside scoop cause I love the fans,&#39;&#39; Flossy said. &#39;&#39;We have a clothing line in the works, even more live shows of course, and simply more Turquoise Jeep. Creativity, that is what the Jeep is about, so as long as we&#39;re breathing we will always practice our craft and that&#39;s real chat.&#39;&#39; Regardless of how much info Flossy wants to give out about the label, he does trust ChaCha when it comes to winning an argument. &#39;&#39;When my publicist hit me up about the interview I was all for it, I had a homie that put me on to ChaCha, he used to hit yall up all the time to make his point in a argument, yall got juice baby.&#39;&#39; So, what is Turquoise Jeep Records all about? Even after speaking with the label, the answer is just as fuzzy. Maybe it&#39;s best to let Flynt Flossy speak for himself. &#39;&#39;I have a Turquoise Jeep as does everyone else. There is a Turquoise Jeep in all of us, feel me baby?&#39;&#39;<br> <br>','','13 - 13 USD','2013-05-19 19:00:00','2013-05-20 02:00:00','2013-03-17 13:01:30','2013-03-17

Combine Kylie Hartman&#39;s Blues/Rock flare and Molly Fiorentino&#39;s mash-up of Mediterranean Pop and Dance Club sounds, and listeners are guaranteed a memorable show. This unique Pop duo is one to remember. From their distinct voices to their prominent looks, these two performers complement each other in true yin-yang fashion. With such contrasting backgrounds, it’s amazing that these young ladies work together so harmoniously. Kylie Hartman grew up with a constant desire to perform. Before she was even old enough to be enrolled in school, she was performing in front of cameras. Her flare for entertainment, evident in her bold stage presence, became the hallmark of countless home videos. At the age of 10, Hartman’s dad taught her how to strum her very own 6-string. Throughout the rest of her adolescence, she sang and played in nearly every talent show and local coffee shop. Born in Wisconsin but raised in Colorado, Hartman and her family moved to Idaho when she was fourteen years old. It was there that she graduated high school and enrolled in college. Unlike Hartman, Molly Fiorentino was born and raised in Boise, Idaho. Fiorentino grew up with every intention of going straight into the medical field after high school. She had never performed, never tried singing, and certainly never considered a career in music. After plans for college fell through, Fiorentino had to rethink her future. With a natural mind for music, and a newfound realization of the industry’s pivotal impact on the world, she decided to go into Music Production. After sharing a few songwriting ideas with a Seattle-based mentor, Fiorentino was strongly encouraged to jump into the vocal booth to experience the recording process from the other side. Seeing Fiorentino’s potential as an artist, her mentor recommended that she develop her unique voice. From that point on, Fiorentino extended her artistry to the performing front as well. After two and a half years of working on her own, Fiorentino was invited to check out live music at a coffee shop in Meridian, Idaho. It was there that she met Steady Rush’s other half. With fresh resolve to pursue a musical career, Kylie Hartman was in the middle of performing when Fiorentino walked through the door. As soon as they met, the pair was inseparable. They found comfort in knowing that they shared passion and hope in the same belief--that music should awaken all that is good and honest in humanity. Before their paths crossed in 2009, Hartman and Fiorentino had each been developing as songwriters. Naturally, writing original material became one of their favorite perks of teaming up as a duo. All of their songs come from personal experiences, and from a place of desperation for mankind to be better. For them, the desire to positively affect the world drives them harder than any other motivation. It’s not about money and popularity for these two, it’s about so much more. </p></p>','','$5.00 - $10.00','2013-04-04 19:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-21 03:11:03','2013-03-21 03:11:03','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/powerhouse-presents-steady-rush-desirae-bronson-/E0-001-055338937-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-04 02:58:39',3,1),('E0-001-055340022-8',1,'V0-001-000164045-1','Diego\'s Umbrella','<b>Age Limit: </b> 21+<br> <br> Diego&#39;s Umbrella<br> <br> <br> <br>','','$10 Advance, $15 Day of Show','2013-04-12 20:30:00',NULL,'2013-03-21 04:13:38','2013-03-21 04:13:38','evdb','http://eventful.com/gardencity_id/events/diegos-umbrella-/E0-001-055340022-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:19',3,0),('E0-001-055345379-8',1,'V0-001-000323937-4','Boise State Swimming','','','','2013-06-07 00:00:00','2013-06-09 00:00:00','2013-03-21 17:28:16','2013-04-01 19:48:15','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/boise-state-swimming-/E0-001-055345379-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:01:12',3,0),('E0-001-055346305-0',1,'V0-001-006824765-5','Brown Bus Company Blood Drive','<p>Donation Type:  Blood</p><p>BloodBanker, Inc. is a blood plasma donation advocacy group where giving blood and donating plasma for money helps save many lives.

Later it hit me.  I was able to do this because the knowledge I had in my head of knowing God as my Father had gone down to my heart and I not only knew it, but was now living it.”<strong></strong><p><strong>A School Teacher: </strong>“As a teen, my family sent me away.  I felt like I died that day and was shipped off in a<strong> </strong>coffin.  I believe because of that I suffered for 12 years with a feeling of suffocation and debilitating muscle and joint pain for which I took heavy medications.  After the workshop, I discovered not only was my heart healed, but my body as well for I no longer needed the pain medications and I could breathe freely for the first time in years!<strong></strong><p><strong>A Christian Therapist: </strong>“God used HeartChange as a catalyst for several of my clients to get ‘unstuck’ and experience meaningful change in their hearts and lives. It also profoundly impacted my own family; and I would heartily recommend it!”<p><strong>A Web Page Consultant: </strong>&quot;I entered the weekend a little skeptical, but willing to accept what was said, as long it followed Scripture.  At the workshop, I discovered I had had the message written on my heart that I was worthless.  I also realized that I had spent my life trying to live up to how everyone else thought I should be.  God cleaned house!  I then knew my value before God.  It wasn’t an emotional high; it was real, true and rock solid.  I am so thankful that God cared about me, down to every last dark wounded whisper in my heart.

A new breed of modern American metal was erected in the 2000s, with Lamb of God serving as an architect, designing the blueprint that would become the standard by which bands that came after them would be judged. So often, the European metal scene has set the tone and established the creative high watermark of the global metal scene, providing the template that their American brethren would follow. Then Lamb of God came along and all bets were off. It was Lamb of God who rewrote the rules, devised a new playbook and raised the standard. The genre was forever and irrefutably changed by what the band has done. By the mid-00s, there was a full metal Renaissance, if you will, in America, with the genre enjoying several years of renewed success and critical respect. Lamb of God worked to establish themselves without question as the scene&#39;s alpha males, dominating at every turn, leaving a parade of other acts to merely feast on their leftovers and scraps. Mind you, this was not a scene, style or era populated by middling acts. The era was filled quality bands and still, it was Lamb of God who defined the time period and that quickly ascended as the game changers and torch bearers. No. Questions. Asked. Turns out, they&#39;ve merely nicked the surface of what they can do and plan on accomplishing. In 2012, Lamb of God remain the pre-eminent metal band and not by default, either. The scene is still healthy, even if some of the peers who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with them during that period of growth have fallen by the wayside. Lamb of God still reign atop of the genre thanks to their consistent ability to feed fans with only the best extreme metal there is. Their seventh album Resolution finds the band firing on all cylinders and doing things their way. As if we&#39;d expect anything less from this Virginia wrecking crew. With a rich history including three Grammy nominations, an invitation to tour with Metallica (which they did in 2008 through 2010 on the World Magnetic trek); multiple debuts in the Top 10 on the Billboard Top 200 (2009&#39;s Wrath debuted at No. 2 while 2006&#39;s Sacrament debuted at No. 8); multiple Platinum-selling DVDs (Killadelphia and Walk With Me in Hell); an arena tour with Slipknot (which took place in 2005); the main stage of OZZfest (2006) and wearing the fact that they were banned in Los Angeles (the Forum had a problem with their name and booted them off the bill of two shows, one with Slipknot and one with Metallica) as a badge of honor, there&#39;s no question that Lamb of God rule the metal roost. Everyone else is left to watch and marvel, and choke on their dust. However, they&#39;re not resting on past successes or what they&#39;ve done. For Lamb of God, what happened in 2002 happened in 2002. It&#39;s about the right now and what&#39;s next: Resolution. With Resolution, Lamb of God emerged from their haven in the South as powerful, as hungry and as extreme as ever. While most bands are running on fumes or coasting and sputtering to album No. 7, Lamb of God are reinvigorated. They still have something to say and more to prove…to themselves and no one else. This sonic terror squad has come along way from playing squats in basements as Burn the Priest with one constant element: the instinct to make legit, honest music their way, which is just what they&#39;ve done with Resolution. &quot;The first and foremost thing that you have to realize about LOG is that we do exactly what we want, when we want, and how we want to,&quot; declares vocalist Randy Blythe. &quot;We always have and we always will. That&#39;s why each record is a snapshot in time. We never consciously sit down and say &#39;We&#39;re going to keep it heavy. We&#39;re going to keep it metal.&#39; We just do that because that&#39;s what we want to do. If we felt like putting out a polka record tomorrow, we would. We&#39;re trying to make &#39;smart&#39; heavy music.&quot; </p></p>','','$25.00 - $45.00','2013-05-24 20:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-23 05:25:27','2013-03-25 05:17:25','evdb','http://eventful.com/gardencity_id/events/lamb-god-/E0-001-055382259-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:58',3,0),('E0-001-055382474-7',1,'V0-001-000989747-1','Spring Break at World Center for Birds of Prey','Spring Break at World Center for Birds of Prey <br> 03.25.2013 - 03.29.2013 <br> 9 a.m.-5 p.m. <br> World Center for Birds of Prey <br> 208-362-8687 <br> <a href=\"http://www.peregrinefund.org/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.peregrinefund.org/index.php</a><p> A discounted admission price and special activities for children make The Peregrine Fund&#39;s World Center for Birds of Prey a great spring break destination.

Fueled by a burning desire to rage harder, play louder and have more fun than any other band, Cancer Bats mix hardcore, southern metal and punk rock into a lethal rock and roll explosion. The band originated in May of 2004 with singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, former member of Toronto metal band At The Mercy Of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Refused, Black flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was rounded out with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Mike Peters on drums. The four-piece wasted no time writing and recording songs for a self-released EP that saw light in January of 2005 (later reissued on Oct 31 2005 on vinyl by Tragicomedy Records).

But Lawrence, Kansas‘ Appleseed Cast emerged from all of the above tougher for the experience. After six years together and four full-length albums, including 2001‘s breakthrough double album, Low Level Owl, the band underwent internal problems, and their label for 2003‘s Two Conversations, the much-missed Tigerstyle Records, folded. Instead of calling it quits, the Appleseed Cast took a much-needed hiatus. Drummer Josh Baruth left the band, and Nathan Richardson came on board. Then the foursome, including Chris Crisci (vocals/guitar), Aaron Pillar (guitar), and Marc Young (bass), began working on their fifth full-length, Peregrine, an album that combines the emotional, aggressive sound of their earliest releases with the dynamic and experimental work that characterized their later albums. Peregrine bears the scars of Appleseed Cast‘s past. Whatever personal or band problems the group endured, they‘re exorcized them on this album‘s contemplative instrumentals, beginning with the echoing opener, &quot;Celebration,&quot; which climbs and dives over its four minutes. Peregrine is a female name associated with restless wandering, and it‘s also the name of the daughter in the album‘s recurring storyline. Here Peregrine is a ghost, a daughter, a reminder of secrets waiting to be dug up. Woven around Peregrine‘s 13 tracks is a horror story of violence and familial guilt, which Crisci makes all the more easy to imagine with his plaintive voice. It would be a bit scary if the songs weren‘t so lush and pretty. Hiatus now over, the Appleseed Cast can celebrate ten years together this tour -- if only nature would let them. &quot;For the second time in a week we were stuck in a snow storm and had to cancel the show,&quot; they wrote on their website last week. But we think they‘ll pull through. </p></p>','','$10.00 - $12.00','2013-05-10 19:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-29 04:40:49','2013-04-09 03:42:17','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/appleseed-cast-/E0-001-055563323-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:39',3,0),('E0-001-055563342-2',1,'V0-001-000257374-9','Becoming The Archetype','<p> Supporting Acts: Bermuda, The Burial, Our City Skyline, The Hundredth Man </p>','','$13.00 - $15.00','2013-05-26 18:30:00',NULL,'2013-03-29 04:41:18','2013-04-09 03:42:19','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/becoming-archetype-/E0-001-055563342-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:59',3,0),('E0-001-055563346-8',1,'V0-001-000869786-5','Cusses','<p> Supporting Acts: RevoltRevolt, Lucid Aisle <p> Cusses <br> Cusses aren&#39;t easy to define.

A band that would be right at home taking center stage at CBGB. Lead singer Angel Bond was introduced to drummer Brian Lackey through mutual friends, and they have not separated since. The two headed to Savannah, Georgia in 2009, and met up with Brian&#39;s long time friend, guitarist and past band mate, Bryan Harder (they opened for post-hardcore legends Fugazi in their last band together!).

Seattle power pop quartet The Hoot Hoots bring all that and more as they pledge allegiance to the United States of Have-A-Good-Time, and its obvious in both their live shows and in their two 2011 full length releases, Silly Lecture Series and Appetite for Distraction. In reviews of their live shows and albums, the Seattle Weekly has compared them favorably to the Shins, the Deli Seattle Magazine has praised them for their &quot;flashy, out-of-control pop sensibilities,&quot; and countless audiences from venues across Seattle can bear witness to their dedication to creating a fun, energetic performance. Think vintage Flaming Lips with a splash of NES and a dash of the Unicorns and you get the idea. Lead vocalist/guitarist Adam Prairie grew up with his brother/drummer Chris in the middle of Midwestern corn fields in Clifton, IL. The two played whiffle ball and Nintendo, watched the original Star Wars trilogy obsessively, and learned to play guitars, drums, and Casio keyboards in the bedroom they shared for most of their formative years. <p> Starskate <br> &quot;&#39;Trash rock&#39; would probably be the most appropriate descriptor for this garage fourtet. Starskate specializes in the kind of fast, fizzy, thrashy tunes that start with a drummer hitting his sticks together at a tempo that&#39;s decidedly slower than the actual song.&quot; --East Bay Express </p></p></p>','','$5.00','2013-04-26 21:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-29 04:41:25','2013-03-29 04:41:25','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/hoot-hoots-starskate-/E0-001-055563348-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:05',3,0),('E0-001-055563864-9@2013033021',1,'V0-001-002359017-6','Milestone','','','','2013-03-30 21:00:00',NULL,'2013-03-29 04:59:56','2013-03-29 04:59:58','evdb','http://eventful.com/jerome/events/milestone-/E0-001-055563864-9@2013033021?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-03-29 15:00:23',3,0),('E0-001-055563864-9@2013040219',1,'V0-001-002359017-6','Milestone','','','','2013-04-02 19:30:00',NULL,'2013-03-29 04:59:56','2013-03-29 04:59:58','evdb','http://eventful.com/jerome/events/milestone-/E0-001-055563864-9@2013040219?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-02 10:07:21',3,0),('E0-001-055563864-9@2013040919',1,'V0-001-002359017-6','Milestone','','','','2013-04-09 19:30:00',NULL,'2013-03-29 04:59:56','2013-03-29 04:59:58','evdb','http://eventful.com/jerome/events/milestone-/E0-001-055563864-9@2013040919?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-09 02:58:00',3,0),('E0-001-055563864-9@2013041619',1,'V0-001-002359017-6','Milestone','','','','2013-04-16 19:30:00',NULL,'2013-03-29 04:59:56','2013-03-29 04:59:58','evdb','http://eventful.com/jerome/events/milestone-/E0-001-055563864-9@2013041619?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:25',3,0),('E0-001-055564226-2',1,'V0-001-001383870-3','Left Coast Country -

(&quot;Such A Difficult Child&quot;) is sent to live in England after her parents die in India.  Misselthwaite Manor turns out to be a gloomy fortress.  Her uncle is rarely home and his young son, Colin, never leaves his room, convinced he’s an incurable invalid.  Mary discovers a strange walled garden that has been locked up for years.  With the gardener’s apprentice, Dickon, a lad who can talk to the animals, Mary coaxes the garden back to life.  The garden seems to have a wonderful, magical effect on all who come into it, allowing Mary to help restore Colin to health and a reunion with his father.  The score is bright and delightful:  &quot;Take a Flower To the Fair,&quot; You Can Do It,&quot; &quot;Something’s Happening With Master Colin.&quot;  This version also introduces the endearing Sowerby family (&quot;One Big Happy Family&quot;). </p>','','Adult Ages 13+ 11.24 <br><br>   Students Ages 6-12 8.17 <br><br>   Child Ages 3-5 4.07 <br><br>   Complementary Ticket 0.00

The Las Vegas-based rapper began rapping at just 8 years old with the group &quot;DaFuture&quot; with his brother and very close friend – his mother wrote his raps at the time. &quot;My Mom was like Joe Jackson,&quot; says Wright, &quot;She was a concert promoter so I was exposed to the music industry early – we even did youth reporting at... major awards shows like the BET Awards.&quot; At 17-years old with several years of experience Dizzy decided to take his rap career seriously. Formerly known as Dizzy D Flashy, Dizzy was a winner on BET&#39;s &quot;Wild Out Wednesdays,&quot; winner of the Sheikh Music &quot;Rip the Mic&quot; Competition and released 5 mixtapes, which lead him to rack up over 1-million views on YouTube. Wright wants for people to learn something when they listen to his music by discussing situations that his fans can relate to. &quot;The internet allowed me to see what my music did to people – I like being able to see the response. When you rap, you have a voice and this is how I balance my thoughts,&quot; says Wright. In November 2011, Wright signed to Funk Volume after being discovered at the Sheikh Music &quot;Rip the Mic&quot; Competition in 2010. Impressed by his smooth flow, confident stage presence and energy that won over the crowd, Funk Volume knew he was a special talent and would be valuable addition to the team. On the heels of his latest mixtape &quot;Soul Searchin&#39; Next Level,&quot; Wright will release &quot;Smoke Out Conversations&quot; on February 20th, and says the tape was inspired by Don Miguel Ruiz&#39;s widespread book, &quot;The Four Agreements.&quot; &quot;I live the four agreements. The first agreement is be impeccable with your word. People will learn something from this mixtape. </p></p>','','$17.50 - $36.50','2013-05-12 19:00:00',NULL,'2013-04-03 13:12:15','2013-04-03 13:12:15','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/dizzy-wright-/E0-001-055746570-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 03:00:41',3,0),('E0-001-055747369-3',1,'V0-001-000869786-5','Nekromantix','<p> Nekromantix <br><br> Beloved psychobilly outfit Nekromantix will be loading up their hot-rod hearse and tearing up the nation&#39;s asphalt during the summer months for another barn burning tour of North America.

It is part-concert and part-performance act, made up of three robots, two stuffed apes, three &quot;headless hornsmen&quot; playing backup brass, and their human, &quot;JBOT&quot;. The group is composed of JBOT, the human &quot;slave&quot; to the robots (whose intestines hang from his abdomen); DRMBOT 0110, a severed doll&#39;s head that plays the drums; GTRBOT666, who plays bass and guitar; AUTOMATOM, the assistant drummer created by robots, The Ape Which Hath No Name who plays tambourine halo; The Son of the Ape Which Hath No Name, who plays Monkey Cymbals; and the Headless Hornsmen, a full three-piece horn section. The C!BR backstory claims that the human, in an attempt to make his own band, created the robots. Instead of following him, they revolted, pulled out his intestines and eyes, and now force him to travel the world with them, performing music and making him contemplate the inferiority of the human race. The human, JBOT, is portrayed by actor/musician Jay Vance, a former bassist for ska punk bands Blue Meanies and Skankin&#39; Pickle.

The doctors gave him about 4 months to live. No one liked to be around him.    He was miserable, angry, grey, ashen and in loads of pain. He had tried many different products and procedures but nothing was working. Then my mother suggested he try this very simple 10 day cleansing protocol. It didn’t cost a lot of money compared to traditional methods, but he was skeptical and reluctant to spend the money. Let’s just say he is very very frugal with his money. Well ok, so he is a tight wad. Like I said nothing had worked so far and you can’t take your money with you when you die, so I guess he decided why not. <p>When he walked through the door after being away for 10 days our jaws dropped. We were shocked at the results.  In just 10 short days he had lost 15 pounds.  His skin color was a nice natural hue of pink and his hair color had changed as well. He had a sparkle in his eye and a certain swagger in his step.  It was as though he had been re-birthed.  It was dramatic.  <p>It has been 7 years since he did the 10 day cleanse and he is still free of the disease that most people die from within five years.  Now I am not saying this will be your result but I am not finished with my story.  He is enjoying his grandchildren and just witnessed the marriage of one of his grandchildren.  Remember the tightwad part of him. The process had such an impact on him that he offered to pay for any of his children to enjoy this life healing event called the 10 day cleanse.  <p>Well at this point my parents, brother, sister and I did the cleanse.  Not that there was anything life threatening going on with us. Thanks to my dad and mom’s nutritional knowledge we are above average in the health category. We want to stay that way.  Oh my, what an experience.  We all benefited physically, emotionally and spiritually from the cleanse.  I don’t know how to put something like this in words because the 10 day Healing cleanse affects you to your core.  Old habits are easier to let go. Old emotional problems melt away.  Pain that you have been holding on to for years just seems to disappear. </p></p></p></p></p></p>','','Living Waters Wellness Center www.livingwaterscleanse.com You Don&#39;t have to hurt anymore 0.00 <br><br>','2013-04-09 05:30:00','2013-04-09 08:30:00','2013-04-05 06:51:05','2013-04-05 06:51:05','evdb','http://eventful.com/boise/events/you-dont-have-hurt-anymore-/E0-001-055852028-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-09 02:58:00',3,0),('E0-001-055863055-0',1,'V0-001-006881048-8','All Stylist Summer Launch & Training in Boise, ID','<p>Hey girls, this is going to be so fun!  Our Summer line will have launched and we will have blast showing it off, you will fefinitely want to see it!  Come and join us for some fabulous time together to help make your business all you want it to be.  You will not want to miss this!  Plus we need to know who our family of stylist are in this area!  We hope to see you there!<p><br></p></p>','','All stylist Training in Boise,ID 0.00 <br><br>','2013-04-15 17:30:00','2013-05-13 19:30:00','2013-04-05 12:17:42','2013-04-05 12:17:42','evdb','http://eventful.com/meridian_id/events/all-stylist-summer-launch-training-boise-id-/E0-001-055863055-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:25',3,0),('E0-001-055867061-9',1,'V0-001-006757339-5','Beginning QuickBooks','Teaching workshop participants how to take QuickBooks to an advanced level is the purpose of Intermediate QuickBooks.

It tells the story of Belle, an intelligent young woman scorned by her townspeople for being a bookworm, weary of fighting off the advances of the arrogant Gaston, and dreaming of escape. When her father gets lost in the woods and captured by the forbidding Beast, a once-handsome prince turned into a monster by a witch, Belle goes off to rescue him. Taken with her, the Beast agrees to release Belle&#39;s father if she agrees to stay with him forever. Initially repulsed, Belle soon finds much to appreciate in the Beast&#39;s hidden, tender nature. The Beast&#39;s servants -- a clock, a teapot, and a candlestick -- see Belle as their salvation: if the Beast and a woman fall in love before his 21st birthday, he will be free from the curse.<br><br> All three performances will be at 7 p.m. and features a cast of 26 high school and 31 elementary-aged students. <br><br> For will call tickets, the cost is $7 for adults and $5 for children by calling Nampa Christian Schools at (208) 466-8451.

Sponsored by NNU, World Relief, and the National Latino Evangelical Association, the conference will bring together national and state leadership for a day of conversation, reflection, and action on immigration reform. G92 aims to formulate a Biblical response to immigrants in our communities and across the nation.<p> <p><em><strong>From the G92 website:</strong></em><p>&quot;<strong>G92 began at Cedarville University in October of 2011.</strong>  It takes its name from the ninety-two references to the <em>ger</em>—the immigrant, in Hebrew—in the Old Testament.  Students, faculty, and administrators at Cedarville joined together with individuals from about twenty other colleges and universities to hear biblical teaching, to raise awareness about the realities of immigration, and to equip Christian college students across the country to learn from, minister to, and advocate with immigrant communities.<p><strong>Thanks to the various partnering organizations listed below, </strong>G92 has now grown into a student movement that seeks to understand and respond to the challenges and opportunities of immigration in ways consistent with biblical values of justice, compassion, and hospitality.  The G92 movement includes regular conferences, student groups on various campuses, and this website, formerly known as UnDocumented.tv, which includes resources for campus groups, conference information and registration, videos, and a regularly updated blog.<p><strong>We would love to hear from you! <a href=\"http://g92.org/blog/?phpMyAdmin=31f44o1hU7O3oWOxiFnU2z1lyx1\" title=\"Visit the blog...\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visit the blog</a> and let’s start the conversation.</strong><strong>&quot;</strong></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>','','Visit EventBrite.com for pricing.','2013-04-24 08:45:00','2013-04-24 22:00:00','2013-04-09 16:29:31','2013-04-09 16:29:31','evdb','http://eventful.com/nampa/events/g92-nnu-immigration-conference-/E0-001-056119735-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic','2013-04-10 02:59:52',3,0),('E0-001-056119879-9',1,'V0-001-000569323-9','Tennis 201 Fort Boise - Session 2 (June)','<p>Tennis 201 will be held Saturday mornings from 9:00am-10:30am on June 8, 15, 22, 29.

And he makes no bones about it. Dan is commonly spotted at concerts perching on monitors or screaming at the drumset.

It may be blasphemous to detract from this biography by going beyond this undeniable fact. Fact: his gut-wrenching, pants-wetting solos have been known to move audience members to tears. Prepare for some serious face-melting from this incendiary God of Guitar!\r\n \r\nBen McKee – Bass\r\nMany fans know that Ben has an inhuman ability to consume spicy substances.Everyone knows that he has a glorious collection of chest hair.Few know that Ben dropped out of the Berklee School of Music with one semester left to join the band. It’s just how he rolls.Ben is currently in outpatient rehab attempting to overcome a serious addiction to “Bass Face”, but we secretly hope he can’t give it up! \r\n       \r\nDaniel Platzman – Drums\r\nDaniel may be a native of Atlanta, GA, but he is rocking it with the best in LA.
