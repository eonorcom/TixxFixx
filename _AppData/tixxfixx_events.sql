The band has worked hard for the past decade, spending months and years away from family while on the road in search of the stability a successful career brings. The missing links of their line-up have been solidified, and there is a new partner in independent record label Executive Music Group. All together, fate has caught up with the band in a positive way. Since 2007, the trio of vocalist Paul McCoy, lead guitarist Eric Weaver, and rhythm guitarist Justin Rimer has been the core of 12 Stones. Mike McManus joined in 2010, with Brad Reynolds becoming the band\'s bassist recently, continuing the build the legacy that began in Mandeville, Louisiana over a decade ago in 2000. When asked about what each brings to the table when it comes to influences, singer McCoy reveals, \"each and every member of this band has a personality that is unique. We all grew up in different areas and love different types of music. I grew up listening to nothing but country when I was young. I then fell in love with the 90\'s grunge phase. Eric grew up listening to blues and classic rock and was highly influenced by his father, who is an amazing guitar player as well. Justin grew up in the world of metal, and had success prior to joining 12 Stones as both a recording artist and writer. Mikey has a more eclectic taste in music citing , everything from Dream Theatre to Michael Jackson, while Brad has been in the more pop driven world, so together we bring a ton of different ideas to the table that end up as 12 Stones music.\" Weaver and McCoy emerged from anonymity via the self-titled debut 12 Stones (2002), and had a significant rise through two years of steady touring alongside McCoy\'s appearance on the debut hit from Evanescence \"Bring Me To Life.\" It did not take long for the public to take notice of the young band, as the debut went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies. Potter\'s Field (2004), Anthem for the Underdog (2007), and an EP titled The Only Easy Day Was Yesterday (2010) followed, delivering a significant following that stretches across the U.S. and The World today. To date, cumulative sales of 12 Stones recorded music exceeds two million units. A new partnership with independent label the Executive Music Group (EMG, via Fontana / Universal), and a recording that is the realized vision of a decade of finding their voice in Only Human, has delivered a renewed passion for the future of the band. Singer McCoy stated, \"we recently signed to EMG records. Thanks to them we have found a new love for this industry. I think that people forget how hard it is to succeed when you don\'t have the right people in place. We think that we are finally poised to break through the mold. I have never felt stronger about what we are doing and I think that this is only the beginning for this band.\" Guitarist Weaver added, \"EMG, and their partners in Fontana / Universal, are all supporting the vision that we have for the band. We\'ve always wanted to reach out to our fans that are all over the world, and finally we are getting to do that. Our first tour in support of Only Human will be in Japan, and the opportunity to tour globally, and get to our fans locally, is something we have been waiting years for.\" Only Human defines many of the qualities that transparently represent who these individuals are mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Rimer offers, \"We all have inner struggles as humans and temptations in life. While we don\'t always choose the right path the first time, we learn from our experiences and become stronger. We all make mistakes and fall short sometimes, but it is the art of learning from these experiences that makes all the difference.\" McCoy adds, \"The album title comes from knowing that we all eventually fall short of our expectations regardless of financial, emotional, physical well being. But in the same breath, we all strive to find a way to better ourselves. That\'s human nature. There are always two sides to people. It\'s all about realizing that we all bleed the same. we are ALL human. \" Lyrically, the songs capture the essence of life\'s challenges. The track \"I\'m With You\" documents the impact a friend\'s suicide had on the band members. It is a song of hope for those that are going through the trials we all face and the hardships that are a part of life. Weaver reflects, \"\'I\'m With You\' is a song of comfort that you are not alone and nothing is worth the ultimate capitulation of taking your own life.\" According to Rimer, \"\'Bulletproof\' is a missive to stand up for whatever it is that you fight for and believe in. No matter how many times you may get knocked down you have to keep fighting and allow nothing to stop you from attaining your desires.\" The energy of \"Worlds Collide\" is a prime example of this theme as the lyrics explore the battle of good and evil, and the personal, inner battle to find your way in search of the better cause. As Rimer points out, \"Whatever may drag or down or pull you under can be overcome. The choice is up to you.\" For McCoy, he shares, \"I find the strongest emotional attachment to \'That Changes Everything\'. It is a song about giving in and giving up on something that has been a part of your life in a big way. But right before we succumb to the pain, we realize that the person that has been hurting you has been hurting just as bad the whole time. That\'s what gives us a new chance to make everything better. The whole time, we feel like no one can understand OUR pain but we couldn\'t see that they were going through the same thing.\" From the beginning of the band\'s career, 12 Stones has straddled the worlds of spiritual and secular music. All the while, they have retained their integrity to be true to who they are individually and collectively. There are no messages, and inevitably like all writers they look towards offering a lyrical experience where the listener experiences a personal connection. In many ways this album title truly defines who they are, and the reality that there is nothing evangelistic about them. Each band member does possess a level of personal faith, but they simply are only human. The live show of 12 Stones has always been an engaging experience, rocking with intensity one moment, and tuning it down to a slow, emotional experience the next. With Only Human, the repertoire is as diverse an array of compositions as they have ever delivered on one album. It truly captures the full gamut of human emotions. Rimer offers, \"You\'re not always energized and ready to throw down. Sometimes moments in life are more heartfelt than others and it shows in these songs. We write how we feel and out of that you get a very diverse record. There is something for everyone on Only Human. \'Bury Me\' is special, and we all really hope a lot of people discover, hear and feel this song. Amongst the five tracks we brought in string players for, this one really stands out for me personally. I think it will touch an awful lot of people.\" Weaver adds, \"I hope those that listen can find comfort, healing, and all the other emotions that move us and make music such a special vehicle. People should walk away feeling inspired when they hear this album. The connection to the human spirit is paramount to inspired songwriting, and there is no question we all aimed to capture something real and meaningful here.\" In summing it up, McCoy shares, \"we hope that they get excited when listening to or being around us. We are very passionate about our music. We love hearing stories about how we have brought something good to someone\'s life with our music.\" . A decade plus in, the band has survived in a large part due to the strong connection they have with their fans. The track \"Psycho\" was written specifically about the experience they share together within the setting of a live event. The message is simply, forget all your troubles and allow for the music to take over. Let loose, forget your cares, alleviate your worries, and let it all go. When entranced in the setting, the goal is inevitably to simply get lost. Weaver shared, \"Without our fans there would be no 12 Stones. We thrive every night off our fans, and as we give it to them, they give it back. McCoy adds simply, \"want to thank everyone for keeping us alive after 10 years.\" Many bands digress and the years go on, running out of inspiration, and falling victim to clichés and formulas. For 12 Stones, the antithesis is the case as they continue to progress and mature. The stage show is stronger than it has ever been; their writing is finding its own unique voice. As Rimer shares, \"I see really big things coming for the band. Our passion and determination are still here, and that really separates us from many of our contemporaries. We\'ve been through some tough times, stuck it out, and now we are here to conquer bigger and better things.\" McCoy states in summation, \"The most important part of this career to all of us is that we are still here wanting to be in this band. It is not because we have to, but it is because we truly love what we do. After more than a decade of touring, you either love what you do or hate it. Each of us remains passionate about this music, our live shows, and I believe our fans feel it. You can tell if someone\'s heart is not in their craft. Our fans, families and friends are the ones that give us strength to step out and do what we love every day. We strive to make our fans understand how much they mean to us, and without all of them we are nothing but a bunch of tattooed loudmouths.\" </p><p></p>',NULL,'2012-08-28 18:30:00',NULL,NULL,'2012-08-28 17:01:18',2,NULL,NULL,1),(6,'E0-001-049300808-3','V0-001-000368423-7','',NULL,'Crown Point','null',NULL,'2012-08-28 19:00:00',NULL,NULL,'2012-08-28 17:01:30',2,NULL,NULL,1),(7,'E0-001-050144236-8','V0-001-001140831-3','',NULL,'Radio Boise Tuesdays: Tartufi also Red Hands Black Feet and Tristan Andreas',' Open from 12 pm - 2 am everyday.

Music gives us new energy and a stronger sense of purpose.\" \"Music is something you can\'t hold in your hands, smell it, taste it or even see it, yet somehow just coming together and feeling these little vibrations that tickle our eardrums can somehow lift us all up out of our most difficult moments in life to unimaginable heights.\" Ironically, often joyous and uplifting The Sound Of Sunshine actually came out of a darker and tougher personal experience for Franti. \"Last August, my appendix ruptured suddenly in the middle of a tour and I ended up in the hospital for eight days while they figured out what was wrong with me,\" recalls Franti. \"I almost died and I wrote many of these songs coming out of that experience while I was in the hospital for another week or so after that. During that time, I really took a moment to prioritize what\'s truly important in my life -- and in the end, that\'s really about the people who I love. Even in that hospital, I could laugh with the people I love, cry with them, and start to find the sun again.\" Well aware that countless others face far worse problems than he did, Franti wants The Sound Of Sunshine to communicate a sense of hope and possibility for anybody who needs it. Franti\'s singularly open spirit reflects his own eclectic and intriguing background. Michael was born to an Irish-German-French mother and an African American and American Indian father in Oakland, then adopted by a Finnish American couple who raised him along with their three biological children and another African American son. While studying at the University of San Francisco, Franti formed the punk band The Beatnigs, and later the far more hip hop-inflected The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. Through it all, Franti has crossed all sorts of musical and physical boundaries in order to make music for everybody. In the mid-Nineties, Franti first formed Spearhead, and increasingly in recent years, he\'s found his own voice musically and his own organic brand of popular success. Franti and Spearhead\'s last album, 2008\'s All Rebel Rockers -- recorded in Jamaica with legendary producers and players Sly &amp; Robbie – became the biggest hit of Franti\'s career, hitting the Top 40 on the Billboard 200, and yielded his biggest hit, the Top 20 \"Say Hey (I Love You).\" \"I had a nice, long time to get ready for that first hit, and so I really appreciated it when it happened,\" says Franti. \"So when we were just mastering the new album, I was saying to my manager, \"Boy, wouldn\'t it be fun to have a sophomore hit?\" He was like, \"Sophomore hit? You\'ve already been through grad school, man\" So yes, I\'ve paid some dues, and that\'s made getting this far -- and still being here -- mean even more to me. The funny thing is that `Say Hey\' went into the Top Twenty right as I was being wheeled into surgery. I got the text, and I thought, `Wow, I\'ve finally got a hit record, and I\'m not even going to live to enjoy it.\' That put everything in perspective too.\" Michael Franti is not a man to openly chase success – in fact; he\'s not a man who even wears shoes(for the last ten years). Still, Franti has absolutely no problem hearing his music on the radio now. \"When I was a kid, I used to listen to AM radio on family vacations in the car, and at family barbeques and my dad would leave the radio on. So songs that were the silly pop hits became a really meaningful part of my childhood - and of my adult life now. So when I think of the fact that there\'s some family out there on the beach in the summer together listening to `Say Hey,\' it makes me feel really good. The truth is a good pop song that makes you feel good can be something of value and meaning to people.\" Arguably the most cohesive, romantic and life-affirming album that Franti and Spearhead have ever made, The Sound Of Sunshinereflects the fact that, as Franti puts it, \"With time, you get a better sense who you are and how to put together all your musical passions into your own sound. I feel like for a long time, I dabbled in other sounds. Like `Let\'s do something with a reggae vibe here.\' Or `Let\'s really rock here.\' But now, I write everything from the acoustic guitar up -- which keeps you honest. Then Jay Bowman, my songwriting partner and I, take a lot of time figuring out what\'s the best way to present this song and make every word of it come across and ring true.\" Even the recording process for The Sound Of Sunshine reflects Franti\'s desire to communicate directly with his audience. \"We started in Jamaica actually recording a bunch of tracks with Sly and Robbie who are, of course, great, and we used some of those tracks. Then we got home and started mixing the record. Then I went to Bali and wrote some more songs, but we still didn\'t have it finished. So we said let\'s bring a portable studio on the road with us. We\'d literally recorded the drums in the locker room of the Toronto Raptors or in the shower of some NHL team. Then we\'d go right onstage and play the song and see how other people would react to it. We\'d see what worked and go back and record it again the next day. So these songs have really been road tested in front of live bodies.\" For Franti, \"To play for people and share your songs with them is to make a real connection. That\'s why we play outside our shows for those who can\'t afford to come inside. They need the songs too – maybe more. That\'s the reality. And as a musician I was on tour with put it recently, \"Our fans didn\'t come to us from a reality show. They came to us from reality.\" And so, we mean something in their lives. We\'re the music they put on when they drive their little kids to school, or hang out with the person they love at night. There\'s no higher honor. So they have an investment in the music. And that means so much because this music is very personal to me too.\" </p><p></p>',NULL,'2012-08-28 18:00:00',NULL,NULL,'2012-08-28 17:29:13',2,NULL,NULL,1),(9,'E0-001-047172428-6','V0-001-001502710-7','',NULL,'Bonnie Raitt','null',NULL,'2012-09-01 19:00:00','http://www.bonnieraitt.com/sites/default/files/photographs/p1.jpg',NULL,'2012-08-28 22:18:26',2,'2012-08-31 11:54:52',1,1),(10,'E0-001-048913025-1','V0-001-000139485-3','',NULL,'The Head &amp; The Heart',' <p> Supporting Acts: Blitzen Trapper, Bryan John Appleby </p><p> The Head &amp; The Heart <br><br> So many decisions in life and in the music we love can come down to a critical tug between the logic in our heads and the hot red blood beating through our hearts. Seattle’s The Head and the Heart live authentically in that crux, finding joy and beauty wedged there. Their music pulses effervescently—both explosively danceable and intuitively intelligent. With Americana roots and strong vocal harmonics that swell like a river, this band finds its anchor in solid songwriting that has even the jaded humming along by the second listen. Leaving a variety of day jobs and academic pursuits, The Head and the Heart came together in the summer of 2009, during frequent visits to the open mic night at Conor Byrne in Seattle\'s Ballard neighborhood. California-transplant Josiah Johnson and Virginia-native Jonathan Russell formed the core songwriting partnership, quickly adding keyboardist Kenny Hensley to the mix. Kenny, then 21, had packed up his piano and moved up to Seattle from California to pursue musical score-writing. The luminous Charity Rose Thielen, violin and vocals, had just returned from a year of studying and playing music in Paris. Drummer Tyler Williams cold left a successful band in Virginia after Jon sent him the demo of “Down in the Valley,” relocating across states to be a part of this. Finally, Chris Zasche, was bartending at Conor Byrne and mentioned one day that he\'d be happy to play bass for the nascent band. It all felt right: The Head and the Heart was born. Whether penning songs on the beach at Seattle\'s Discovery Park, or working out melodies in the piano practice rooms at the Seattle Public Library, Charity describes the early months of the band\'s existence as touched by a shared purpose and connection. She recalls an email she sent to Josiah that summer, confessing that she was “sleepless and penniless, but inspired nonetheless.” The band entered Seattle\'s Studio Litho in early 2010 to record these songs that had been kicking and twisting in the catalytic development of their live show. Recorded by Shawn Simmons at Studio Litho and Steven Aguilar at Bearhead Studio, the band was selling burned copies in handmade denim sleeves at local shows within a few weeks. Self-released in June 2010, the debut album helped build an impressive head-of-steam for the band through the second 1/2 of the year, gaining fans at influential Seattle station KEXP, local record shops (a consistent top 10 seller for Easy Street and the #1 album of 2010 at Sonic Boom), and venues up and down the West Coast, culminating with signing to Sub Pop Records in November. For the 2011 re-release of the album, \"Sounds like Hallelujah\" has been re-recorded, live favorite \"Rivers and Roads\" has been added, and the album has been re-mastered. The songs resulting from those first inspired months pick at the multicolored threads of leaving home, finding home, and through that process of deconstruction, finding yourself. These are songs about crossing rivers and roads to get to the one you love, about family far away, and the desire to chase Technicolor dreams down foreign horizons. When people hear these songs, or see the band live, the first thing they have to do is tell someone else. Their shows are, simply, one hell of a lot of breathless fun. Each song explodes into a potent supernova on stage, where half the audience is zealously singing along with every lyric, and the other half is wishing they knew the words. The band has accepted nearly every show offered to them in the past year, from backyards strung with Christmas lights to coffee shops, open mics, and even high school classrooms in Middle America. From the first months of the band\'s life, their reputation as a phenomenal live band has preceded them wherever they play. The strength of Josiah, Jon and Charity\'s vocal harmonies on the album makes it feel like these three were born to pour their voices together, as the band\'s songs revel in jaunty bass lines with ebullient handclaps peppering the best moments. A palette of orchestral elements weave their way through the album, including cello, glockenspiel, and violin, all shading in the songs\' development. For all the times your toes tap while enjoying this band, often the lightness will deceptively belie the depth of ache in the lyrics when you sit down to really listen. There is magic in the music, but not magic contrived by trickery or posturing. “It seems actually that the more genuine and honest we are in the songwriting and performing, the more people relate to that transparency,” Charity muses. This is an album for people who unabashedly sing and drum along on the steering wheel, and also for those who appreciate a well-crafted collection of songs that build into something wholly beautiful. There is in this music a counter-cultural optimism, with roots that grow deep and melodies that lodge themselves far into that place inside you where the head meets the heart. </p><p></p>',NULL,'2012-09-20 20:00:00',NULL,NULL,'2012-08-28 22:30:57',2,NULL,NULL,1),(11,'E0-001-047660769-2','V0-001-003589077-8','',NULL,'Bonnie Raitt','null',NULL,'2012-08-30 19:00:00','http://www.bonnieraitt.com/sites/default/files/photographs/p-slipstream_1.jpg',NULL,'2012-08-29 08:40:45',2,'2012-08-29 13:57:58',2,1),(12,'E0-001-048796327-5','V0-001-000368423-7','',NULL,'The Jezabels','null',NULL,'2012-09-08 22:00:00','http://www.stoffersgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jezabels.jpg',NULL,'2012-09-05 16:38:54',1,'2012-09-05 17:18:46',1,1),(13,'E0-001-050682555-7','V0-001-000368423-7','',NULL,'iRock',' Friday 9/07/2012<br> Mainstage<br> www.reverbnation.com/irockidahocom <br> $5 Cover <br><p><br><strong>iRock</strong><br></p><p></p><p>GENRE: covers</p><p></p><p></p>',NULL,'2012-09-07 00:00:00','http://i207.photobucket.com/albums/bb291/yungckc/irock.jpg',NULL,'2012-09-05 18:02:50',1,'2012-09-05 18:49:52',1,1),(14,'E0-001-050954189-6','V0-001-000368423-7','',NULL,'Haven David Snow',' Thursday 9/06/2012<br> Mainstage<br> 9:00 Patio <br> No Cover <br><p><br><strong>Haven David Snow</strong><br></p><p></p><p>GENRE: Acoustic Singer Songwriter</p><p></p><p></p>',NULL,'2012-09-06 00:00:00','http://i.ytimg.com/vi/UFDVWbV47yQ/0.jpg',NULL,'2012-09-05 18:28:19',1,'2012-09-05 18:28:27',1,1),(15,'E0-001-050954183-2','V0-001-000368423-7','',NULL,'Manimou Camara',' Thursday 9/13/2012<br> Mainstage<br> 9:00 <br> $3 Cover <br><p><br><strong>Manimou Camara</strong><br></p><p></p><p>GENRE: African Drum and Dance </p><p>MORE INFO: <a>www.douniadjembe.com/</a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>',NULL,'2012-09-13 00:00:00','http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SBvgtT2-z-U/TotpcIkIEBI/AAAAAAAAAt8/kpoHeRh9qHA/s1600/manimou%2Bdjembe%2Bolywa.png',NULL,'2012-09-05 18:40:59',1,'2012-09-05 18:41:02',1,1),(16,'E0-001-050941773-9','V0-001-001140831-3','',NULL,'Radio Boise Tuesdays: Dedicated Servers w/ guests',' Open from 12 pm - 2 am everyday.

Many go to their live shows with reservations, high expectations, and the burning question, \"Do these guys sound like the real Dave Matthews Band?\" Almost always the answer is, \"Yes!\"<br><br> As Rick Grant of Entertaining U in Jacksonville, FL wrote, \"The Dave Matthews Tribute Band turned out to exceed its billing as a quality improvisational band that uses Dave Matthews material as themes to improvise. Clearly, this distinguishes them from the other so-called tribute bands. The band is exceptionally tight and produces a solid groove over which the players improvise with hot chops.\"<br><br> Hailing from Buffalo, NY, the Dave Matthews Tribute Band is the only nationally touring tribute to the Dave Matthews Band. This 6-piece ensemble strives to pay homage to their famous counterparts by matching the excitement, energy, intensity and intimacy of a DMB live show.<br><br> \"We have so much respect for DMB and what they\'ve been able to accomplish,\" says lead singer Ryan Clifford. \"As fans, we love getting together with others to celebrate and give tribute to DMB and their music.\"<br><br> The Dave Matthews Tribute Band has worked hard to bring musical expertise and an energetic stage presence to remake and provide fans with a true \'DMB experience\'. \"The whole basis of the band is to put on a musical play,\" says Clifford. \"We try to recreate the experience you may get from the real band.\"<br><br> While most fans never experienced a live DMB show before they became the platinum-selling artists they are today, the Dave Matthews Tribute Band prides itself on giving audiences this opportunity at intimate venues across the country.<br><br> Beyond mastering the DMB sound and the relentless touring, what separates the Dave Matthews Tribute Band from other cover bands is their passion, love, and respect for DMB and their music. That is what makes you come out of one of their shows saying, \"Yeah, they really do sound like the real Dave Matthews Band.\"',NULL,'2012-09-19 20:00:00','http://media.mlive.com/kzgazette/entertainment/photo/the-dave-matthews-tribute-band-b91c30b35aab2500_large.jpg',NULL,'2012-09-10 21:37:44',1,'2012-09-10 21:37:50',1,1),(21,'E0-001-052856270-2','V0-001-001140831-3','null',NULL,'Go Listen Boise Holiday Show','Open from 12 pm - 2 am everyday.

Combine Kylie Hartman\'s Blues/Rock flare and Molly Fiorentino\'s mash-up of Mediterranean Pop and Dance Club sounds, and listeners are guaranteed a memorable show. This unique Pop duo is one to remember. From their distinct voices to their prominent looks, these two performers complement each other in true yin-yang fashion. With such contrasting backgrounds, it’s amazing that these young ladies work together so harmoniously. Kylie Hartman grew up with a constant desire to perform. Before she was even old enough to be enrolled in school, she was performing in front of cameras. Her flare for entertainment, evident in her bold stage presence, became the hallmark of countless home videos. At the age of 10, Hartman’s dad taught her how to strum her very own 6-string. Throughout the rest of her adolescence, she sang and played in nearly every talent show and local coffee shop. Born in Wisconsin but raised in Colorado, Hartman and her family moved to Idaho when she was fourteen years old. It was there that she graduated high school and enrolled in college. Unlike Hartman, Molly Fiorentino was born and raised in Boise, Idaho. Fiorentino grew up with every intention of going straight into the medical field after high school. She had never performed, never tried singing, and certainly never considered a career in music. After plans for college fell through, Fiorentino had to rethink her future. With a natural mind for music, and a newfound realization of the industry’s pivotal impact on the world, she decided to go into Music Production. After sharing a few songwriting ideas with a Seattle-based mentor, Fiorentino was strongly encouraged to jump into the vocal booth to experience the recording process from the other side. Seeing Fiorentino’s potential as an artist, her mentor recommended that she develop her unique voice. From that point on, Fiorentino extended her artistry to the performing front as well. After two and a half years of working on her own, Fiorentino was invited to check out live music at a coffee shop in Meridian, Idaho. It was there that she met Steady Rush’s other half. With fresh resolve to pursue a musical career, Kylie Hartman was in the middle of performing when Fiorentino walked through the door. As soon as they met, the pair was inseparable. They found comfort in knowing that they shared passion and hope in the same belief--that music should awaken all that is good and honest in humanity. Before their paths crossed in 2009, Hartman and Fiorentino had each been developing as songwriters. Naturally, writing original material became one of their favorite perks of teaming up as a duo. All of their songs come from personal experiences, and from a place of desperation for mankind to be better. For them, the desire to positively affect the world drives them harder than any other motivation. It’s not about money and popularity for these two, it’s about so much more. </P>\r\n<P></P>','/boise/events/powerhouse-presents-steady-rush-desirae-bronson-/E0-001-055338937-8','2013-04-04 19:00:00',NULL,NULL,'2013-03-29 16:12:05',5,NULL,NULL,1),(26,'E0-001-054827138-5','V0-001-000139485-3','null','','The Jason Lugo Band plus The Brian Bateman Blend / Moon Pies','','/boise/events/jason-lugo-band-plus-brian-bateman-blend-moon-pies-/E0-001-054827138-5','2013-03-30 20:00:00',NULL,NULL,'2013-03-29 16:15:31',5,NULL,NULL,1),(27,'E0-001-047723573-9','V0-001-000368423-7','null','','The Well Suited','Saturday 3/30/2013<br> Mainstage<br> 9:30 <br> $5 Cover <br><p><br><strong>The Well Suited</strong><br></p><p></p><p>GENRE: Indie Pop Rock</p><p></p><p></p>','/boise/events/well-suited-/E0-001-047723573-9','2013-03-30 00:00:00',NULL,NULL,'2013-03-29 22:03:01',5,NULL,NULL,1);
