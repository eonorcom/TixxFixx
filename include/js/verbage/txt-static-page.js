pageBody[1]="Hello,<br /><br />Thanks for stopping by.  We would like to welcome you to LDS Music Charts.  This site is dedicated to one specific purpose and one purpose only:<blockquote>To help the youth of the church find good, clean music to listen to.</blockquote>That is it!  It is that simple.

LDS Music Charts isn't just a list of songs that are sung by Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  It is a list of popular and some not so popular songs that have good lyrics, clean messages and in most cases a great beat!   These list are divided into three main charts:<ol><li>Events</li><li>Tours</li><li>Transportation</li></ol>Events are the 200 most popular songs voted on by you!  Yes, that's right. You have the opportunity to vote on any song in our library.  These songs are sorted by ratings and ranked on our Events Chart.  The Tours chart is a list of the 500 most played and best songs for any Stake Dance.  This is a great resource the next time you need to approve a DJ for a dance, just tell him \"You can only play what is on LDS Music Chart's Tours!\"  How easy is that?  Finally, there is the Transportation Chart.  This chart is specific to only LDS artist of any genre.<br /><br />Oh, speaking of genres, we have also categorized every song into specific genres to help you find that type of music you like to listen to.   Yep, that's how cool we are.<br /><br />So, you think this is the coolest site ever and you want to know how you can help make it better.  Well, funny you should ask!
